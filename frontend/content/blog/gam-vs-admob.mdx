One of the most common questions we hear from publishers is: "Should I use AdMob or Google Ad Manager?" The answer depends on your specific situation, but let's break down the key differences to help you decide.

## What is AdMob?

AdMob is Google's mobile advertising platform designed specifically for app developers. It's built for simplicity and ease of use, making it the go-to choice for most mobile app publishers.

**Best for:**
- Mobile app developers
- Publishers who want a simple setup
- Those primarily using Google's ad demand
- Smaller to medium-sized operations

**Key features:**
- Easy SDK integration
- Built-in mediation
- App-focused analytics
- Automatic ad optimization

## What is Google Ad Manager?

Google Ad Manager (formerly DFP - DoubleClick for Publishers) is an enterprise-grade ad serving platform. It offers much more control and flexibility, but comes with added complexity.

**Best for:**
- Large publishers with complex needs
- Those with direct sales teams
- Publishers needing advanced targeting
- Multi-platform operations (web + app)

**Key features:**
- Direct deal management
- Advanced inventory controls
- Sophisticated targeting options
- Detailed reporting and forecasting
- Programmatic guaranteed deals

## Key Differences

### 1. Complexity

AdMob is designed to be simple. You can be up and running in minutes. Google Ad Manager has a steeper learning curve and requires more setup time, but offers far more customization.

### 2. Direct Sales

If you have a sales team selling ads directly to advertisers, you need Google Ad Manager. AdMob doesn't support direct-sold campaigns.

### 3. Inventory Control

GAM gives you granular control over your ad inventory—you can set floors, create custom targeting keys, and manage complex hierarchies. AdMob handles most of this automatically.

### 4. Reporting

Both platforms offer reporting, but GAM's is significantly more detailed. If you need to slice and dice data in specific ways, GAM provides more dimensions and metrics.

## Can You Use Both?

Yes! Many publishers use AdMob for their mobile apps while using GAM for their websites. You can also use GAM as a layer on top of AdMob for more control while still accessing AdMob's demand.

## Our Recommendation

**Start with AdMob if:** You're a mobile app developer, want quick setup, and don't need direct sales capabilities. AdMob's simplicity lets you focus on building your app while still maximizing ad revenue.

**Choose Google Ad Manager if:** You have complex needs, a direct sales team, multiple properties, or need advanced inventory controls. The extra complexity is worth it for larger operations.
