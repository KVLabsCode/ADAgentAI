Today, we're excited to announce that ADAgent is now open for early access. After months of building and testing with a small group of beta users, we're ready to welcome more publishers to the platform.

## What You Get

During the early access period, you'll have free access to all ADAgent features:

- **Natural language queries:** Ask questions about your ad performance in plain English
- **Multi-platform support:** Connect both AdMob and Google Ad Manager accounts
- **Real-time data:** Get answers based on your actual platform data, not cached reports
- **Chat history:** Review and export your past conversations
- **Unlimited queries:** No limits during early access

## Why Early Access?

We believe the best products are built with user feedback. During this period, we're actively listening to how publishers use ADAgent and what features would make their lives easier.

Your feedback directly shapes our roadmap. Many of our current features came from beta user suggestions, and we're committed to continuing that collaborative approach.

## What We're Working On

Based on early feedback, here's what's coming soon:

- Scheduled reports delivered to your inbox
- Custom alerts for performance changes
- Team collaboration features
- Additional ad platform integrations
- Advanced visualization options

## How to Join

Getting started is simple:

1. Sign up with your Google account
2. Connect your AdMob or Google Ad Manager account
3. Start asking questions

The whole process takes less than 2 minutes. No credit card required—it's completely free during early access.
