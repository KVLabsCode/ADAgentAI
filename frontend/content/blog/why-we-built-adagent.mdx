If you've ever managed ad monetization for a mobile app or website, you know the pain. Logging into multiple dashboards, exporting CSVs, building spreadsheets, trying to make sense of metrics that don't quite align across platforms.

We lived this frustration for years. As app developers and publishers ourselves, we spent countless hours each week just trying to answer simple questions: "How much did we make yesterday?" or "Which ad units are underperforming?"

## The Breaking Point

The final straw came during a quarterly review. We needed to present ad performance data to stakeholders, combining metrics from AdMob, Google Ad Manager, and our internal analytics. What should have been a 30-minute task turned into a full day of data wrangling.

That's when we asked ourselves: *Why isn't there a better way?*

## The Vision

We imagined a world where you could simply ask questions in plain English and get immediate, accurate answers. No more dashboard hopping. No more manual exports. No more formula errors in spreadsheets.

What if you could just type "What was my revenue last week compared to the week before?" and instantly see the answer, complete with context and insights?

## Building ADAgent

We started building ADAgent in late 2025, combining our expertise in ad tech with the latest advances in AI. The core principle was simple: make ad platform data accessible through natural conversation.

Key decisions we made early on:

- **Read-only access:** ADAgent should never be able to modify your ad settings. Security and trust come first.
- **Real-time data:** No stale caches. When you ask a question, we query your actual platform data.
- **Plain English responses:** No jargon dumps. Answers should be clear and actionable.
- **Multi-platform support:** Start with Google's ecosystem (AdMob, GAM), then expand.

## What's Next

We're now in early access, and the response has been incredible. Publishers are saving hours each week and discovering insights they never had time to find before.

But this is just the beginning. We're working on advanced analytics, automated reporting, and support for additional ad platforms. Our mission is to make ad monetization management effortless for everyone.

If you're tired of the dashboard shuffle, we'd love for you to try ADAgent. It's free during early access, and we're actively incorporating feedback to make it better every day.
